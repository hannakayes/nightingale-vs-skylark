Description
“It was the nightingale, and not the lark” is what Shakespeare wrote in the 16th century – in literature, nightingale and skylark have been contestants for the most beautiful song since humans started writing about them. High time they settle their battle once and for all. Make them sing loud and clear – but beware of noisy objects flying by!

MVP
- Game starts upon clicking START button
- Skylark jumps up upon pressing SHIFT key
- Screen moves downwards
- Skylark moves left upon clicking ARROW LEFT
- Skylark moves right upon clicking ARROW RIGHT
- NIGHTINGALE is singing
- Objects (boombox, car, plane) are moving downwards, potentially hitting Skylark but not Nightingale
- Score to the left shows time and amount of objects doged

Backlog
- Game is paused upon hitting PAUSE button
- Skylark sings its song when flying / pressing SHIFT key
- Objects (boombox, car, plane) make noises when moving into the frame
- Score shows amount of time in which the SHIFT button has been pressed (reflecting singing and flying)
