<h3>Description</h3>
“It was the nightingale, and not the lark” is what Shakespeare wrote in the 16th century – in literature, nightingale and skylark have been contestants for the most beautiful song since humans started writing about them. High time they settle their battle once and for all. Make them sing loud and clear – but beware of noisy objects flying by!
